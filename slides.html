        About me: 
        Salutations, here is a brief bio of who I am. 

        Healthcare professional turned tech enthusiast. Korean American, born and raised in the big apple. CUNY Queens College graduate. I love to watch and play sports. I’m a die hard, FC Barcelona, New York Yankees, NY Giants and Los Angles Lakers fan. I enjoy gaming; both board games and video games, also am into anything comic related like Marvel, or DC lore, but I always enjoy a good fantasy drama or movie like; GOT, LOTR so I’m somewhat of a nerd. Being extremely active is one of my daily goals, whether its going to the gym, weightlifting and hitting new PR’s or snowboarding, hiking, biking or even taking my Siberian Husky for a run I’m never sitting still, unless I’m eating. Speaking of eating, I’d like to consider myself a foodie; I LOVE TO EAT FOOD. It is thrilling trying new cuisines and things I’ve never had when given the opportunity, in general I will never say no to food. Other small details about me are; I’m a memorabilia collector, as well as having statues, Funko Pops and sneakers in my collection vault.
