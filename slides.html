                <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <p></p>Healthcare professional turned tech enthusiast. Korean American, born and raised in the big apple. CUNY Queens College graduate. I love to watch and play sports. Iâ€™m a die hard, FC Barcelona, New York Yankees, NY Giants and Los Angles Lakers fan. I enjoy gaming; both board games and video games, also am into anything comic related like Marvel, or DC lore, but I always enjoy a good fantasy drama or movie like; GOT, LOTR so Iâ€™m somewhat of a nerd. Being extremely active is one of my daily goals, whether its going to the gym, weightlifting and hitting new PRâ€™s or snowboarding, hiking, biking or even taking my Siberian Husky for a run Iâ€™m never sitting still, unless Iâ€™m eating. Speaking of eating, Iâ€™d like to consider myself a foodie; I LOVE TO EAT FOOD. It is thrilling trying new cuisines and things Iâ€™ve never had when given the opportunity, in general I will never say no to food. Other small details about me are; Iâ€™m a memorabilia collector, as well as having statues, Funko Pops and sneakers in my collection vault.
