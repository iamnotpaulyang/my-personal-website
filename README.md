# My Personal Website
The purpose of this project is to help you get more context about me.
The first webpage provides a link to my personal website, as well as having all social media links that I share my work in.
The second webpage is a slide page which provides personal information about myself and my future incoming projects to be announced, along with a get in touch form where you can ask me anything.
